// Barrel re-export so existing `import { ... } from "@/lib/api"` call sites
// keep working unchanged while the implementation lives in per-resource
// files under lib/api/*. New code should prefer importing directly from
// the specific resource module (e.g. `@/lib/api/jobs`).
// Note: auth.ts re-exports session functions that already live in client.ts
// (fetchAuthChallenge, verifyAuthChallenge, refreshAccessToken, logout,
// setJwtToken, getJwtToken) — it's not re-starred here to avoid ambiguous
// duplicate exports. Import it directly (`@/lib/api/auth`) if preferred.
