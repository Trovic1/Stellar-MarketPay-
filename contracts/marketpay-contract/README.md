# MarketPay Soroban Escrow Contract

This Soroban smart contract manages trustless escrow between clients and freelancers on Stellar.

| `reject_milestone(job_id, milestone_id, client)` | Client | Reject and refund a single milestone |

## Build & Test

```bash
# Standard build
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release

# Optimized build (cargo release + wasm-opt -Oz post-processing)
# Requires wasm-opt — install with one of:
#   cargo install wasm-opt
#   brew install binaryen        (macOS)
#   apt install binaryen         (Debian/Ubuntu)
make build-optimized

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Release profile

`Cargo.toml` already configures `[profile.release]` for minimum WASM size:

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `opt-level` | `"z"` | Optimise aggressively for binary size |
| `lto` | `true` | Link-time optimisation — removes dead code across crates |
| `codegen-units` | `1` | Single codegen unit for maximum inlining and dead-code elimination |
| `strip` | `"symbols"` | Strip debug symbols from the binary |
| `panic` | `"abort"` | Replace panic unwinding machinery with a single `unreachable` trap |

After running `make build-optimized` the target binary is:

```
target/wasm32v1-none/release/marketpay_contract.optimized.wasm
```

Use this file (not the plain `.wasm`) when deploying or installing on-chain.

## Deploy

```bash
chmod +x ../../scripts/deploy-contract.sh
../../scripts/deploy-contract.sh testnet alice
```

## Contract Upgrade Process

Soroban upgrades replace only the executable WASM — all on-chain storage
(escrows, proposals, ratings, …) is preserved automatically.

The contract stores a `Version` value in state, so operators can confirm that
the active WASM and the on-chain record are in sync after an upgrade.

### Step-by-step

1. **Build the new WASM**
   ```bash
   make build-optimized
   # Produces: target/wasm32v1-none/release/marketpay_contract.optimized.wasm
   ```

2. **Install the new WASM on-chain** (uploads bytes, returns a hash)
   ```bash
   stellar contract install \
     --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/marketpay_contract.optimized.wasm \
     --source <admin-key> --network testnet
   # → prints NEW_WASM_HASH
   ```

3. **Call `upgrade` with the admin key**
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
     --source <admin-key> --network testnet \
     -- upgrade --new_wasm_hash <NEW_WASM_HASH>
   ```

4. **Verify the version bumped**
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet \
     -- get_version
   # → 2  (or N+1 from previous version)
   ```

5. **Verify existing escrows are intact**
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet \
     -- get_escrow --job_id <any-existing-job-id>
   ```

### Schema migration

If the new version changes a stored struct (e.g. adds a field to `Escrow`),
add a `migrate()` function in the new WASM that reads old records, transforms
them, and writes them back. Call `migrate()` once immediately after `upgrade()`.
Old records that are never touched will be read with default values for new
fields as long as the struct derives `Default` or the fields are `Option<T>`.

## Roadmap

- **v2.0** — Milestone-based partial releases
- **v2.1** — Dispute resolution via 3-arbitrator voting with emergency admin fallback
