# Smart Contract API Reference

MarketPay is powered by two Soroban smart contracts deployed on Stellar:

- **`MarketPayContract`** (`contracts/marketpay-contract/src/lib.rs`) — escrow, milestones, sealed-bid auctions, disputes/bonds, arbitration, governance, certificates, ratings, messaging.
- **`ArbitratorRegistry`** (`contracts/arbitrator-registry/src/lib.rs`) — staking-gated arbitrator registration used to source arbitrators for disputes.

This is the authoritative reference for every public entrypoint, data type, storage key, and event **currently implemented** in those two contracts.

> **Source:** `contracts/marketpay-contract/src/lib.rs`, `contracts/arbitrator-registry/src/lib.rs`
> **Soroban SDK:** 22.0.0
> **Build target:** `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (release)
> **Function count:** `MarketPayContract` exposes **71** public entrypoints; `ArbitratorRegistry` exposes **13**.

## Data Types

### `EscrowStatus`

```rust
enum EscrowStatus {
    Locked,      // Funds deposited; work not started
    InProgress,  // Freelancer accepted; work underway
    Released,    // Client approved; funds sent to freelancer
    Refunded,    // Client cancelled before start; funds returned
    Disputed,    // A participant raised a dispute
    Frozen,      // Reserved state value; the contract-wide freeze is a
                 // separate `Frozen` storage flag, not an EscrowStatus a
                 // given escrow transitions into via any public function.
}
```

### `DisputeBondConfig`

Global configuration set by the admin; when unset, `raise_dispute` runs in legacy zero-cost mode.

| Field    | Type      | Description                             |
| -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `token`  | `Address` | SAC token used for the dispute bond     |
| `amount` | `i128`    | Bond amount required to raise a dispute |

### `DisputeBond`

Per-job snapshot of a locked bond, created when `raise_dispute` is called while a `DisputeBondConfig` is set.

| Field              | Type      | Description                                                |

### `ArbitrationCase`

| Field         | Type           | Description                                     |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `job_id`      | `String`       | Disputed job                                    |
| `arbitrators` | `Vec<Address>` | Selected arbitrators (expected: 3)              |
| `votes`       | `Vec<u32>`     | Each arbitrator's `client_percent` vote (0–100) |

| `status`      | `u32`          | `0` = open, `1` = resolved                      |

> **Note:** `resolve_arbitration(env, case_id)` is the only public entrypoint that operates on `ArbitrationCase` records in the current contract. There is **no public function that creates an `ArbitrationCase`, registers the 3 arbitrators against it, or lets them submit votes** — the corresponding error codes (`OnlyAdminRegisterArbitrators = 7007`, `Need3Arbitrators = 7008`, `OnlyAdminOpenArbitration = 7009`, `ArbitrationCaseNotOpen = 7011`, `OnlySelectedArbitrators = 7012`, `AllVotesSubmitted = 7013`) exist in `errors.rs` but are not wired to any `pub fn` yet. A case record must currently be written directly to contract storage (e.g. by a future admin-only entrypoint, or off-chain tooling during development) before `resolve_arbitration` can be called against it. Treat this as a known gap between the error surface and the implemented API — see also the separate [`ArbitratorRegistry`](#arbitrator-registry-contract) contract, which independently manages staked arbitrator membership but is not yet linked to `ArbitrationCase` creation.

### `DisputeCase`

| `status`      | `u32`          |

### `RecurringEscrow`

Declared in `lib.rs` (retainer-style recurring payments) but **no public entrypoints operate on it yet** — reserved for a future feature.

| Field                 | Type           |

## Events Reference

Events are emitted as `env.events().publish((topic_symbol, subtopic), data)`. Only events actually present in `lib.rs` are listed — several administrative functions (`upgrade`, `set_arbitrator`, `set_default_timeout_seconds`, `add_admin`, `set_unfreeze_threshold`, `set_dispute_bond`) currently emit **no** event and are marked as such below.

### `initialize`

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, treasury_address: Address)
```

Must be called **once** immediately after deployment. Stores the admin address and treasury address, sets the platform fee to 100 bps (1%), escrow counter to 0, default timeout to 7 days (604,800 seconds), unfreeze threshold to 2, admin list to `[admin]`, and `Version` to 1.

**Auth required:** None (open — call immediately after deploy to claim admin).
**Panics:** `"Already initialized"` if called again.

### `upgrade`

```rust
pub fn upgrade(env: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>)
```

Admin-only. Deploys a new WASM implementation via `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)` and increments the stored `Version`. All existing contract storage (escrows, proposals, etc.) is preserved across the upgrade.

**Auth required:** admin (via `require_auth` on the stored admin address).
**Emits:** nothing.

### `get_version`

```rust
pub fn get_version(env: Env) -> u32
```

Returns the current contract version (starts at 1, incremented once per `upgrade()` call).

### `create_escrow`

```rust
pub fn create_escrow(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address, params: CreateEscrowParams)
```

Transfers `params.amount` tokens from `client` into the contract and stores a new `Escrow` with status `Locked`. Emits `escrow_cr`.

**Auth required:** `client`

| Panic condition                                  | Error                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `amount ≤ 0`                                     | `AmountMustBePositive (2001)`        |
| `referrer == client` or `referrer == freelancer` | `InvalidReferrer (2002)`             |
| duplicate `job_id`                               | `EscrowAlreadyExists (2003)`         |
| more than 5 milestones                           | `MaxMilestones (3001)`               |
| any milestone percentage ≤ 0                     | `MilestonePercentagePositive (3002)` |
| milestone percentages don't sum to 100           | `MilestonePercentagesSum (3003)`     |

### `create_escrow_with_deliverable`

```rust
pub fn create_escrow_with_deliverable(
    env: Env,
    job_id: String,
    client: Address,
    params: CreateEscrowParams,
    deliverable_hash: BytesN<32>,
)
```

Same as `create_escrow`, but also stores an expected SHA-256 `deliverable_hash` on the escrow. `release_escrow` will require a matching freelancer-submitted hash (via `submit_deliverable_hash`) before it will pay out. Emits `escrow_cr`.

**Auth required:** `client`

### `create_escrow_with_milestones`

```rust
pub fn create_escrow_with_milestones(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address, params: CreateEscrowParams)
```

Identical code path to `create_escrow` — the distinct name documents intent for callers that are populating `params.milestones`. Milestone percentages must sum to 100 (max 5 milestones). Emits `escrow_cr`.

**Auth required:** `client`

### `start_work`

```rust
pub fn start_work(env: Env, job_id: String, freelancer: Address)
```

Transitions the escrow from `Locked` to `InProgress`. Emits `work_strt`.

**Auth required:** `freelancer` (must match `escrow.freelancer`)
**Panics:** `OnlyFreelancerCanStartWork (2005)`, `EscrowNotLocked (2006)`

### `release_escrow`

```rust
pub fn release_escrow(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address)
```

Client-only release. If the escrow has an expected `deliverable_hash`, it must match the freelancer-submitted hash first (`DeliverableHashMismatch (2009)`). Pays the platform fee (`plat_fee` event) to the treasury, then a referrer bonus (`ref_bon` event) if a referrer is set — capped by `MaxReferrerBonusXlm` when configured, otherwise a flat 2% — then the remainder to the freelancer. Sets status `Released` and increments `CompletedJobs` for both client and freelancer (governance voting eligibility). Emits `escrow_rl`.

**Auth required:** `client`
**Panics:** `OnlyClientCanRelease (2007)`, `CannotReleaseStatus (2008)`, `DeliverableHashMismatch (2009)`

### `release_with_conversion`

```rust
pub fn release_with_conversion(
    env: Env,
    job_id: String,
    client: Address,
    _target_token: Address,
    _min_amount_out: i128,
)
```

Client-only release variant intended to support paying the freelancer out in a different asset via a DEX swap. **As currently implemented, the DEX swap is not wired up** — it transfers the escrow's original token directly, applying the platform fee but **not** the referrer bonus. The `_target_token` and `_min_amount_out` parameters are accepted but unused. Treat this entrypoint as a placeholder pending real cross-asset conversion support. Emits `escrow_rl`.

**Auth required:** `client`

### `refund_escrow`

```rust
pub fn refund_escrow(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address)
```

Client-only. Only allowed while status is `Locked` (before `start_work`). Refunds the full amount to the client and sets status `Refunded`. Emits `escrow_rf`.

**Auth required:** `client`
**Panics:** `OnlyClientCanRefund (2010)`, `CanOnlyRefundLocked (2011)`

### `timeout_refund`

```rust
pub fn timeout_refund(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address)
```

Client-only. Refunds the escrow if the timeout has elapsed while status is still `Locked`. Uses the Unix-timestamp timeout when set (current path), falling back to the legacy ledger-sequence timeout for older escrows. Emits `escrow_rf`.

**Auth required:** `client`
**Panics:** `OnlyClientCanTimeoutRefund (2012)`, `TimeoutNotExpired (2013)`

## Disputes & Dispute Bonds

### `raise_dispute`

```rust
pub fn raise_dispute(env: Env, job_id: String, caller: Address)
```

Client or freelancer only. Not allowed on `Released`/`Refunded`/`Frozen`/already-`Disputed` escrows (`CannotDisputeResolved (7002)`). If an admin has set a `DisputeBondConfig`, this call locks the configured bond amount from `caller` into the contract (transferred via the bond token's SAC), stores a `DisputeBond` snapshot, and emits `bond_lck`. Otherwise it runs in legacy zero-cost mode. Either path sets status `Disputed` and emits `escrow_ds`.

**Auth required:** `caller` (must be the escrow's client or freelancer) — `OnlyParticipantsCanDispute (7001)`

### `resolve_dispute`

```rust
pub fn resolve_dispute(env: Env, job_id: String, arbitrator: Address, winner: Address, split_percentage: u32)
```

**Arbitrator-only** — `arbitrator` must equal the address previously set via `set_arbitrator` (`OnlyAdminCanResolveDispute (7003)`). Escrow must be `Disputed` (`EscrowNotDisputed (7004)`). `split_percentage` (0–100) of the escrow amount goes to `winner`, the remainder to the other participant. If a `DisputeBond` was locked for this job: it's returned to the bond-poster (`bond_rtn`) if they are the `winner`, or slashed entirely to `winner` (`bond_slsh`) if the bond-poster lost — either way the bond record is consumed so a second call to `resolve_dispute` cannot re-settle it. Sets status `Released`. Emits `dsp_res` (plus `bond_rtn`/`bond_slsh` if a bond existed).

**Auth required:** `arbitrator`

### `set_dispute_bond`

```rust
pub fn set_dispute_bond(env: Env, admin: Address, token: Address, amount: i128)
```

Admin-only. Configures the global bond token/amount required to raise future disputes. `amount` must be > 0 (`BondAmountPositive (7006)`). No event.

**Auth required:** admin

### Getters

| Function                  | Signature               | Returns                   | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_dispute_bond_config` | `(env)`                 | `(Option<Address>, i128)` | `(None, 0)` if unset (legacy zero-cost mode), else `(Some(token), amount)` |
| `get_dispute_bond`        | `(env, job_id: String)` | `Option<DisputeBond>`     | Per-job locked bond record, if any                                         |

---

## Arbitration Cases

```rust
pub fn resolve_arbitration(env: Env, case_id: u32)
```

Resolves an `ArbitrationCase` by taking the **median of exactly 3 stored votes** (`case.votes`, each a `client_percent` 0–100) — computed as `sum - min - max`, so it's a true median rather than an average. Requires exactly 3 votes already present (`Exactly3VotesRequired (7014)`; case not found panics with `"Arbitration case not found"`). Sets `case.status = 1` and `case.resolution` to the median. Emits `arb_rsl`.

> As noted under [`ArbitrationCase`](#data-types) above, there is currently **no public entrypoint to create a case or submit the 3 votes** — this function only resolves a case whose `votes: Vec<u32>` already has exactly 3 entries via some other means. Docs and integrations should treat multi-arbitrator arbitration as **not yet fully wired up end-to-end** in this contract, distinct from the single-arbitrator `resolve_dispute` flow above, which is fully implemented.

**Auth required:** none enforced in code (any caller can trigger resolution once 3 votes exist) — contrast with `resolve_dispute`, which is arbitrator-gated.

---

## Milestones

### `release_milestone`

```rust
pub fn release_milestone(env: Env, job_id: String, milestone_id: u32, client: Address)
```

Client-only. Callable while escrow status is `InProgress`/`Locked`/`Disputed`. Finds the milestone by `id`, marks it released, pays out its percentage share of the escrow (minus platform fee — emits `plat_fee` when fee > 0) to the freelancer. If **all** milestones are now released or rejected, the escrow itself transitions to `Released` and `CompletedJobs` is incremented for both parties. Emits `milestone_released`.

**Auth required:** `client` — `OnlyClientCanReleaseMilestone (3004)`
**Panics:** `CannotReleaseMilestoneStatus (3005)`, `MilestoneAlreadyCompleted (3007)`, invalid id → `"Invalid milestone id"` (not in `errors.rs`'s canonical `error_code_from_panic` mapping — see [Error Reference](#error-reference) caveat)

### `release_all_milestones`

```rust
pub fn release_all_milestones(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address)
```

Client-only bulk release (Issue #1480). Releases every milestone that has not already been released in a single call, so a client approving a 5-milestone project no longer needs to submit 5 separate transactions. Equivalent to invoking `release_milestone` once per outstanding milestone in ascending id order — each milestone's share is paid out net of the platform fee (`plat_fee` emitted when fee > 0) and a `milestone_released` event is emitted per milestone. Skipping already-released milestones means a partially released escrow can be finished off with one call. Once every milestone is released the escrow transitions to `Released` and `CompletedJobs` is incremented once for both parties.

**Guard rails (checked before any payout):**
- only the escrow client may call it — `OnlyClientCanReleaseMilestone (3004)`
- escrow status must be `InProgress` / `Locked` / `Disputed` — `CannotReleaseMilestoneStatus (3005)`
- **every** milestone must have `rejected == false`; if any milestone was rejected the call panics with `"Cannot batch release: a milestone was rejected"`
- an escrow with no milestones panics with `"Escrow has no milestones"` (releasing it would otherwise close the escrow while funds stayed locked)

**Auth required:** `client`

### `reject_milestone`

```rust
pub fn reject_milestone(env: Env, job_id: String, milestone_index: u32, client: Address)
```

Client-only. Marks the milestone (by **index**, not `id`) rejected and refunds its percentage share to the client. If all milestones are resolved (released or rejected), the escrow transitions to `Released`. Emits `milestone_rejected`.

**Auth required:** `client`

---

## Job Boost

```rust
pub fn boost_job(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address, treasury: Address, token: Address, amount: i128)
```

Client pays `amount` directly to `treasury` to boost a job listing's visibility (this is a direct payment, not related to the job's escrow). Minimum 5 XLM (50,000,000 stroops) buys a 7-day boost (120,960 ledgers); ≥ 15 XLM (150,000,000 stroops) buys a 30-day boost (518,400 ledgers). Emits `boosted` with the resulting expiry ledger.

**Auth required:** `client`
**Panics:** `MinimumBoost5Xlm (9001)`, `BoostAmountPositive (9002)`

## Auction Functions

MarketPay provides sealed-bid and commit–reveal auction mechanics for job bidding to eliminate anchoring bias, prevent frontrunning, and ensure fair price discovery.

### Auction Lifecycle & Mechanics

The auction system implements a commit–reveal scheme where bidders submit cryptographic SHA-256 hash commitments (`SHA-256(amount_be_bytes ∥ nonce)`) rather than locking tokens on-chain:

1. **Zero Upfront Lockup:** Bidders retain full custody of their funds during the bidding phase.
2. **Privacy:** Bid amounts remain sealed until the auction is closed and the reveal window opens.
3. **Refund Safety:** Losing bidders retain 100% of their initial token balances, and the contract holds zero residual balance.
4. **Minimum Increment Requirement:** Incremental/open bidding pathways enforce a minimum bid increment constraint (e.g., `amount >= current_highest + 100`) to mitigate dust bidding and spam.

### `open_auction`

```rust
pub fn open_auction(env: Env, job_id: String, budget_amount: i128, client: Address)
```

_(Also accessible via `commit_budget` entrypoint)_

Initializes and opens an auction for a given job by registering the client's committed budget. This opens the bidding session and allows freelancers to submit sealed bid commitments.

- **Description:** Stores a `BudgetCommitment` record with `is_revealed = false` and opens bidding for the job.
- **Auth Requirements:** `client` (`client.require_auth()`).
- **Preconditions:**
  - Contract must not be globally frozen (`check_not_frozen`).
  - `budget_amount > 0` (panics with `BudgetPositive (4001)`).
- **Emitted Events:**
  - `budgtcmt`: `(budgtcmt, client)` topic with `job_id` payload.

### `place_bid`

```rust
pub fn place_bid(env: Env, job_id: String, freelancer: Address, commitment: BytesN<32>)
```

_(Also accessible via `submit_bid_commitment` entrypoint; micro-module variant `place_bid(amount: u64, current_highest: u64)`)_

Places a sealed bid for an open auction by submitting a 32-byte cryptographic commitment `SHA-256(amount_be_bytes ∥ nonce)`.

- **Description:** Records a `BidCommitment` for `(job_id, freelancer)` with `bid_revealed = false`. Bidders retain custody of their tokens during this phase. In incremental open auction modules, validates that `amount` meets or exceeds the minimum increment step above `current_highest`.
- **Auth Requirements:** `freelancer` (`freelancer.require_auth()`).
- **Preconditions:**
  - Contract must not be globally frozen (`check_not_frozen`).
  - Auction/budget commitment must exist for `job_id` (`BudgetCommitmentNotFound (4002)`).
  - Auction bidding phase must be open (`BiddingClosed (4005)`).
  - Bidder has not already submitted a bid commitment for this job (`BidCommitmentAlreadySubmitted (4006)`).
  - For incremental bidding: `amount >= current_highest + 100` (panics with `"Bid does not meet the minimum increment requirement"`).
- **Emitted Events:**
  - `bid_cmt`: `(bid_cmt, job_id)` topic with `freelancer` payload.

### `close_auction`

```rust
pub fn close_auction(env: Env, job_id: String, client: Address)
```

_(Also accessible via `close_bidding` entrypoint)_

Closes the active bidding phase for an auction and opens the reveal window (`REVEAL_WINDOW_LEDGERS = 17,280` ledgers ≈ 24 hours).

- **Description:** Transitions the auction `BiddingState` to `is_closed = true` and calculates `reveal_deadline_ledger = current_ledger + 17,280`. Once closed, new bids are rejected and freelancers can reveal their bids via `reveal_bid`.
- **Auth Requirements:** `client` (`client.require_auth()`).
- **Preconditions:**
  - Contract must not be globally frozen (`check_not_frozen`).
  - Auction/budget commitment must exist for `job_id` (`BudgetCommitmentNotFound (4002)`).
  - Caller must be the client who created the auction (`OnlyClientCanRevealBudget (4003)` / `"Only the client can close bidding"`).
  - Bidding must not already be closed (`BiddingClosed (4005)` / `"Bidding already closed"`).
- **Emitted Events:**
  - `bid_cls`: `(bid_cls, job_id)` topic with `reveal_deadline_ledger` payload.

### `refund_bid`

```rust
pub fn refund_bid(env: Env, job_id: String, bidder: Address)
```

Handles settlement and token balance verification for non-winning bids after auction closing and winner selection.

- **Description:** In MarketPay's commit–reveal architecture, bidder funds are not escrowed during the bidding phase. Non-winning bidders retain 100% of their initial token balances without deduction, and the contract maintains a 0 token balance retention. In escrow-backed bidding variants or auction cancellations, `refund_bid` returns deposited tokens back to the bidder's address.
- **Auth Requirements:** `bidder` or automated settlement post-closure.
- **Preconditions:**
  - Auction bidding phase must be closed and reveal window elapsed.
  - Bidder must not be the winning bidder.
  - Bid deposit/commitment must be active and not previously refunded.
- **Emitted Events:**
  - Preserves token balances (or emits `escrow_rf` on refunded deposits).

## Sealed-Bid Budget Commitment

Lets a client commit to a job budget without immediately publishing it (Issue #108). This is a **procedural** seal (a flag), not a cryptographic commitment scheme — contrast with the freelancer bid commitments below, which are hash-based.

| Function                | Signature                                                     | Returns            | Auth     | Notes                                                                                                                    |

## Sealed-Bid Freelancer Auctions

Cryptographic commit-reveal scheme for freelancer bids (Issue #338). A freelancer first submits `SHA-256(amount_be_bytes ∥ nonce)`, then reveals `amount` and `nonce` after bidding closes; the contract recomputes the hash and rejects mismatches.

One rating per job — `FreelancerRatingAlreadySubmitted (5004)`. Stores a `Rating` of the client by the freelancer. No event. |

> **Note:** `submit_client_rating`'s duplicate-submission protection (`RatingAlreadySubmitted (5003)`) and exact auth/status checks should be confirmed against the current `lib.rs` source before relying on them in a client integration — the two rating functions are not perfectly symmetric in the current implementation.

### Reverse mapping caveat

`errors.rs` exposes `ContractError::panic_message()`, `ContractError::code()`, and a free function `error_code_from_panic(msg: &str) -> Option<u32>` that maps Soroban panic/`HostError` strings (including `Error(Contract, #N)` and `Error(Contract, #N): <msg>` formats) back to numeric codes for frontend error handling. **This mapping is not fully synchronized with every `panic!()` call site in `lib.rs`.** Several panic strings used in the wild do not appear in `error_code_from_panic`'s match arms, including (non-exhaustive): `resolve_dispute`'s `"Only the arbitrator can resolve a dispute"` and `"Winner must be the client or the freelancer"`; `mint_certificate`'s `"Only the escrow client can mint the certificate"` and `"Certificate title cannot be empty"`; and assorted milestone/rating/evidence panics such as `"Invalid milestone id"`, `"Milestone already released"`, `"Milestone already rejected"`, `"Only participants can record evidence"`, `"Cannot record evidence on a refunded escrow"`. Frontend code that relies on `error_code_from_panic` to classify a failed transaction should fall back to matching on the raw panic string for these cases until the mapping is completed.

## Arbitrator Registry Contract

`contracts/arbitrator-registry/src/lib.rs` — `ArbitratorRegistry`. A **separate, independently deployed** contract that manages a staking-gated pool of arbitrators. It is not currently invoked by `MarketPayContract`'s dispute/arbitration flow (see the [Arbitration Cases](#arbitration-cases) caveat above) — as of this writing the two contracts are not linked on-chain; any connection between "is a registered arbitrator here" and "is allowed to call `resolve_dispute` on the escrow contract" is enforced off-chain/administratively via `set_arbitrator`.
